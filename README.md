"NextWordLSTM: Real-Time Word Prediction with Shakespearean Text"

ðŸ“˜ Detailed Description:
NextWordLSTM is a natural language processing project aimed at building a real-time word completion system using a word-level Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Trained on the rich and stylistic corpus of Shakespeareâ€™s plays, the model predicts the next word in a user-typed sentence, offering intelligent, context-aware suggestions.

ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives:
Develop a word-level LSTM-based language model trained on Shakespeareâ€™s text.

Create an interactive interface where users can type partial sentences and receive real-time next-word predictions.

Ensure the interface dynamically updates suggestions as users continue typing.

Perform hyperparameter tuning to study its impact on:

Prediction quality

Sentence fluency

Coherence and grammar

Evaluate the model on criteria such as perplexity, prediction accuracy, and user-perceived fluency.

Visualize:

Training and validation loss/accuracy

Word prediction probabilities

Examples of generated completions under different hyperparameter settings

ðŸ“‚ Dataset:
Source: Shakespeare Plays Dataset on Kaggle

Content: A compilation of Shakespearean plays, ideal for stylistic and syntactic learning at the word level.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
Word-level LSTM model for next-word generation.

Real-time suggestion engine with a dynamic frontend interface (e.g., built with Streamlit or Flask + JavaScript).

Comparative analysis of model variations using different LSTM layers, embedding sizes, sequence lengths, and optimizers.

ðŸ“ˆ Deliverables:
A trained LSTM model with visualized training progress.

Real-time user interface for sentence completion.
